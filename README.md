# Predicitve Toolkit

This application allows the user to upload csv format data sets and then configure and run several different types of predictive algorithms simultaneously on the data through a browser-based graphical user interface. This allows contrasting of the performance of the different algorithms and various configurations of their run parameters for any given dataset, principle component analysis and investigation of the nature of the data. The application features the K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes and Rocchio classification algorithms.
